    <h2>SERVICE DESCRIPTION</h2>
    <p>Cirkel is a request-based platform that connects users seeking specific items with users who may be able to
        provide them. Our platform facilitates communication between requesters and providers but is not directly
        involved in any transactions between users.</p>

    <h2>USER CONTENT</h2>
    <p>When you post content on our App, you grant us a non-exclusive, royalty-free, worldwide license to use, store,
        display, and distribute that content in connection with operating and improving our App.</p>

    <h2>TRANSACTIONS BETWEEN USERS</h2>
    <p>Cirkel facilitates connections between users but is not a party to any transaction between users. All
        arrangements for payment, delivery, returns, and any other terms related to a transaction are solely between
        users. Users engage in transactions at their own risk.</p>

        <li>Process payments between users</li>

    </ul>
    <p>Account termination may be temporary or permanent, depending on the severity of the violation.</p>

        ANY INDIRECT, INCIDENTAL, SPECIAL, CONSEQUENTIAL, OR PUNITIVE DAMAGES, OR ANY LOSS OF PROFITS OR REVENUES,
