    <h1>CIRKEL - TERMS OF SERVICE</h1>

    <h2>INTRODUCTION</h2>
    <p>Welcome to Cirkel ("we," "our," or "us"). These Terms of Service ("Terms") govern your use of the Cirkel mobile application (the "App"), including any related services, features, content, and functionality.</p>
    <p>By downloading, accessing, or using our App, you agree to be bound by these Terms. If you do not agree to these Terms, please do not use our App.</p>

    <h2>IMPORTANT NOTICE</h2>
    <p>Cirkel is currently operating in beta testing phase as a non-commercial platform. We are not yet formally established as a business entity in Ghana. These Terms are provided to establish guidelines for using our platform during this developmental stage.</p>

    </ul>
